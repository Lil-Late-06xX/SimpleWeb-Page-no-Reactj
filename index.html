                                                        She was a slave of the Eldian king, who abused her power to bring prosperity to Eldia while devastating Marley and the rest of the world.
                                                        Thirteen years after awakening her power, she died protecting the king; her corpse was then forcibly cannibalized by their daughters, Maria,
                                                        Rose, and Sheena. Her powers then split into what eventually became known as the Nine Titans.
                                                        Upon her death, Ymir was transported to the Coordinate, where she molded Titans out of the sands and obeyed the royal family whenever they sought the Founder's power.

                                                   <h2>More Bout The Founder: </h2>

                                                 <p>The Founding Titan (始祖の巨人 Shiso no Kyojin?, also translated as Progenitor Titan) was one of the Nine Titans and the first of all Titans. Its Scream (叫び Sakebi?) could create and control other Titans and modify the memories and body compositions of the Subjects of Ymir,
                                                    but this power had historically only been able to be used by members of the royal family.

                                                    According to Marley's Titan Biology Research Society,
                                                    the Founding Titan was the point where the paths connecting all Subjects of Ymir and Titans cross.[3] Because of this, those who hail from Marley sometimes called it the "Coordinate" (座標 Zahyō?).
                                                    
                                                    Eren's Founding Titan form is known as Doomsday Titan</p>

                                                    <h2>Titan control: </h2>

                                                    <p>  By screaming, the Founding Titan granted its user the ability to control Titans at
                                                         will and make them follow virtually any order without question. This was demonstrated by Eren Yeager, 
                                                         who unintentionally commanded nearby Pure Titans to eat Dina Fritz's Titan and attack the Armored Titan.
                                                          It appeared to be only effective on Pure Titans, although those with the power of the Titans can still feel
                                                           its influence.[10] It was also used by Karl Fritz to build the Walls, who commanded many Colossus Titans to
                                                            harden their bodies and confine themselves within the resulting structures. In ancient times, Eldia used to use
                                                             this ability to command an army of Titans for war; however, once set loose, these Titans became indiscriminate
                                                              weapons of mass destruction that would slaughter Eldia's enemies.[11] This ability had no known range, although
                                                               Karl Fritz used it to command Colossus Titans that span across a large portion of Paradis Island. Rod Reiss claimed
                                                                the power has the capacity to wipe out all the Titans, if used to its full potential.

                                                                  As noted by Erwin Smith, Titans are simply transformed humans (specifically, the Subjects of Ymir);
                                                                   therefore, the screams that control the minds of the former should be able to affect the latter as well.
                                                                    It was used by Karl Fritz to make the Subjects of Ymir inside the Walls forget the history of the world before the Walls' installation.
                                                                     It was also used by Frieda Reiss to remove Historia's memories of her visits.[16] These memories, however,
                                                                      appeared to be accessible in dreams, as Historia would sometimes be able to dream about her encounters with Frieda,
                                                                       although she would forget about them once she awoke.[17] Members of the Ackerman bloodline were resistant to this ability
                                                                        while anyone who was not a Subject of Ymir was unaffected by it.
